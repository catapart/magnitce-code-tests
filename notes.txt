## Providers
`export` a constant named `providers` to inject arbitrary objects into test calls

## Events
The `<code-tests>` element dispatches the following events:
- `start`: 
- `finish`: 

## Attributes
The `<code-tests>` element uses the `src` attribute.
The  `test`, `tests`, `run`, and `path` attributes are aliases of the `src` attribute.

The `success` attribute is assigned to `true` or `false` when tests have finished.

## Styling
The `<code-tests>` element can be styled with CSS, normally, but it also makes use of the shadowDOM for it's layout and functionality. Each of the elements in the `<code-tests>` element's shadowRoot can be selected for styling, directly, by using the `::part()` selector.

In this example, the `header` part is being selected for styling:
```css
code-tests::part(header)
{
    /* styling */
}
```
